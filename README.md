=============

Just to wrap up, Renjie, do you have a credit card for Twilio we could use? You can sign in and upgrade to a normal paying account with the following credentials. Let me know if I can help with this or if you have any questions: 

Username: design@nextdaybetter.com
Password: ndbetter

Sid's already deployed this text messaging portion to heroku here: http://ndb-toronto.herokuapp.com/

The git repo is located here: https://github.com/sidjha/ndbetter_tdot 

The data is being placed in parse here: https://parse.com/apps/ndbetter/collections 
Login for Parse: 
username: design@newdaybetter.com password: ndbetter

Once the twilio account is upgraded, we can receive texts from anyone.
